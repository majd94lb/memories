This isn't a project.  
It's a dump of thoughts I couldn't say out loud.  
A backup of the parts I didn’t want to forget — or wanted to hide.

Every file, every line...  
is a footprint I shouldn't have left.

I used to believe you could control your presence.  
VPNs. Burner accounts. Fake names.  
But the internet remembers everything — even the parts you try to erase.

If you're digging through this, you're either curious, bored, or hunting...


Whatever you're after — don't trust the surface.
